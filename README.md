# Context API - Redux Refactor

## Description

This project entailed refactoring the state management in an existing MERN eCommerce web app in order to use Redux. While Context API provides sufficient state management, this refactor provided the opportunity to learn Redux as another way to decouple state from components.

The app now uses Redux to build and maintain the web store. Local state was maintained for form inputs, but the important data is now managed globally.

The refactor involved:

- Creating actions and reducers through Test-Driven Development
- Setting up global state
- Adding state data to global state
- Integrating IndexedDB so users can shop offline
- Adding Stripe for payment
- Deploying to Heroku using Mongo Atlas
- Seeding the deployed app from the command line
